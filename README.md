# temp-proj-ats-b2b-golf-store
TEMPORARY repository to facilitate the buildout of the ATS B2B Project.

This repository houses a stylesheet file. Once edited, the stylesheet is published to a public link. This link can then be inclueded in the head section of an experience cloud site.

Public Link to stylesheet: https://studioscience.github.io/temp-proj-ats-b2b-golf-store/style.css

## Content Security Policy
CSP will need to ALLOW list the published URL.

## Temporary Solution
Once development is complete, and the stylesheet is stable, it will be included in the Salesforce Experience Builder site either as a static resource or directly into the HEAD of the site.

This will ensure as many sources as possible are housed in Salesforce servers.
